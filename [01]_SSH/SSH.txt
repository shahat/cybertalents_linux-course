1.0 => Windows Vs Linux in Security

   -  Linux is usually installed on the most important, mission-critical systems.
   -  Most security appliances also run Linux  “Firewalls/Routers/IDS”.
   -  In Windows all logged-in Users can have Administrator privileges while in 
         Linux there is the idea of limited access accounts and a superuser called
         root which controls all users’ privileges, the root is equivalent to the Administrator in windows.
   -  Most security appliances also run Linux  “Firewalls/Routers/IDS”.

2.0 => SSH connection: Y we need it 
    There are a lot of scenarios that you want to log into your system but you are away from it, that’s why we need SSH

3.0 => What is SSH? ... The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) .. port 22 but not always

cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

NOTE :  Typical applications include remote command line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.

4.0 => connect using ssh 

- ssh username@serverhost   ...  - serverhost is the ip || domain name of the remote server 
                                 - userName is the user  
                                 - -p port_number to add the port number different to 22  


- another way is to use the private and public ssh keys 
      private key in your computer and the public you send to the server this is good bcz the server dosent ask for password when you try to connect 


ssh-keygen => generating the ssh key 
ssh-copy-id root@serverhost => provide the publick key for the remote sercver

after that you can create the ssh

 
-------------------

=> copy file to remote files 

- scp index.html username@servername||ip:/var/www  this  is secure copy file into directory to the remote server 

 - allow remote adminstration of servers
