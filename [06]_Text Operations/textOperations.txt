=> What is the Linux command line? 

    - The Linux command line is a text interface to the computer that is often referred to as the shell , terminal, console, prompt and other names.
 
    -  The command line is a computer program intended to interpret commands. 

    -  So, basically, a shell is a program that receives commands from the user and gives it to the OS to process, and it shows the output.

=> what is text manipulation 

Text manipulation is the process of using computer automation to modify text files on a large scale to suit the needs of the user.


An example of this can include changing the first character of every word in a text document to uppercase or changing every instance of a misspelled word throughout an entire document, to the correct spelling.

Also, consider the example below:

    Cybertalents: This is the first char uppercase
    CYBERTALENTS: This is all uppercase
    CyBeRtAlEnTs: This is alternate-uppercase
    cYbErTaLeNtS: This is alternate-lowercase

=> Text manipulation tools

There are many important text manipulation commands ranging from basic to expert level depending on how comfortable you are with the Linux system. However, in this article, we will only touch on the following,

    Sort
    unique
    tr
    Cut 
    Awk
    Base64 encoding algorithm



 
 - Sort command : 
    Sort command is used to sort a file, arranging the records in a particular order. 

   By default, the sort command sorts files assuming the contents are ASCII. 
   Using options in sort command, it can also be used to sort numerically.


  cat mm.txt | sort 
    line num1
    line num2
    line num3
    line num4
    line num5
    line num6
    line num7
    line num8
    line num9






 - Uniq Command

The uniq command in Linux is a command-line utility that reports or filters out the repeated lines in a file. 

In simple words, uniq is the tool that helps to detect the adjacent duplicate lines and also deletes the duplicate lines.

 uniq filters out the adjacent matching lines from the input file(that is required as an argument) and writes the filtered data to the output file.

cat mm.txt 

 abs 
 abs 
 aca 
 aca 
 mh 

 
cat mm.txt  | uniq

 abs 
 aca 
 mh 





-  The tr command 
in UNIX is a command-line utility for translating or deleting characters. It supports a range of transformations including uppercase to lowercase, squeezing repeating characters, deleting specific characters and basic find and replace. It can be used with UNIX pipes to support more complex translation. tr stands for translate.



    - tr [options] SET1 [SET2]

    without options  replaces each of the characters in SET1 with  SET2 that have the same position.

    - tr  e o 
    welcome
    wolcomo

    - this convert the upper case to the lower case 
    tr A-Z a-z : 

    - Delete characters
    echo "your pin is : 4568" | tr -d [:digit:] // this will delete all numbers 

    and more



- Cut Utility

    The cut command in UNIX is a command for cutting out the sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output. 

    It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character, and field.

    Basically, the cut command slices a line and extracts the text.
    It is necessary to specify options with commands otherwise it gives errors. If more than one file name is provided then data from each file is not preceded by its file name.


    Now let’s assume we want to print the first three bytes of each line to do that we can use the command


    echo mm.txt 

    line number 1 
    line number 2 
    line number 3 
    line number 4 
    line number 5 
    line number 6 

    echo mm.txt | cut -b 1,2,3 filename
    lin
    lin
    lin
    lin
    lin
    lin

    Now let’s assume we want to print the first word and the third word of each line to do that we can use the command

    =>  cut -d “ ” -f 1,3 filename

    line 1
    line 2
    line 3
    line 4
    line 5
    line 6


- Awk Utility

Awk is a utility that enables a programmer to write tiny but effective programs in the form of statements that define text patterns that are to be searched for in each line of a document and the action that is to be taken when a match is found within a line. 

Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing.

 It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that match with the specified patterns and then perform the associated actions.

Awk command will be as follows:
awk options 'selection _criteria {action }' input-file



- Base64 Encoding Algorithm

Base64 is an encoding algorithm that allows you to transform any characters into an alphabet that consists of Latin letters, digits, plus, and slash.

 Thanks to it, you can convert Chinese characters, emoji, and even images into a “readable” string, which can be saved or transferred anywhere.

You can decode any text from base64 using the base64 command with -d as argument
